# Pet Shop - Test Driven Development
This app lists a demonstration of Test Driven Development. I was given a test script and was
tasked with creating functions which would allow the tests to pass.

# Run App
To run the tests use the following command in terminal:
```Ruby
ruby specs/pet_shop_spec.rb
```
